1. Pick a probelm you ‘re interested in .
ans. quora-insincere-questions-classification

2. Understand the problem
ans. on website today is how to handle toxic and divisive content so we wants to tackle this problem head-on to keep their platform a place where users can feel safe sharing their knowledge with the world.  A key challenge is to isolate insincere questions, develop models that identify and flag insincere questions

3. Identify your ideal outcome like : Note that the outcome may be quite different from how to assess the model and it’s quality .. our ideal outcome is keeping with the example


4. Understand the evaluation matric : write down your metrics for success and failure with ml system . The failure metrics are important ..


5. Exploratory Data analysis  / Get conclsion about atleast of Baseline model
ans.  we are added some features as part of features engineering 
	1. freq_id = frequencey of qid
	2. qlen = length od qid 
	3. n_words = number of words in questions
	4. numeric-words = number of numeric words in question . 

6	Identify baseline model

how to get baseline model - this is very common query but very nice question without checking data just flying with your knowledge of problem statements ... with different alogorithm diversity ..


7. write down in words theories or assumptions / statistical test for validate of theories ..

8. Choose the algorithm

9. In the algorithm accordingly : clean the data

10. In the algorithm accordingly: scaling the data

11. In the algorithm accordingly: feature transformations

12. In the algorithm accordingly : feature derivations

13. In the algorithm accordingly : cross – validation 

14. In the cross – validation : Do the feature selections 

15. In the cross – validation choose Hyper parameter optimizations like Grid Search

16. Check with data leaks, imbalance

17. Train algorithm for baseline

18. Train many algorithms 

19. Low cost function optimizations process

20. Hyper-parameters tunning 

21. Ensemble -  Combinding different models

22. Evaluation – Manually examines the error / Identify more ways of doing numerical evalucation

23. Finally – model deploment processs / intergration into apps

24. Inference  - new real life leading to model predictions
